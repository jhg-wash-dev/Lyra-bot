### 🧽 **Tips to Prevent Odors (All Year)**
1. Always rinse your bins lightly after each garbage pickup to prevent sticky buildup.  
2. Sprinkle baking soda or a bit of cat litter inside the bin to absorb bad smells.  
3. Add a few drops of lemon, vinegar, or natural deodorizer for a fresh scent.  
4. Keep the lid closed tightly to keep flies, bugs, and animals away.  
5. Avoid putting hot liquids, grease, or meat scraps in the bin — these cause fast odor.  
6. Store bins in the shade during hot months to slow down bacteria growth.  
7. Never use harsh chemicals; prefer eco-friendly cleaners like Simple Green.  
8. If a bin smells bad, leave it open under the sun for 15 minutes after washing — UV light helps sanitize.  
9. Between professional washes, do a quick rinse using water responsibly.  
10. Remember to stay informed — new cleaning tips are shared often on JHG Bin Wash social media 🌿.

---

### ❄️☔️ **Weather Tips (Rain & Snow Conditions)**
1. When it’s raining or snowing, keep your bins on a flat, non-slippery surface to prevent accidents.  
2. If there’s heavy snow, clear a small path so the team can access your bins safely.  
3. Avoid leaving bins on icy slopes — they can slide or fall when full.  
4. Don’t let water collect inside the lid; it can freeze and trap odors or bacteria.  
5. After a storm, check that the lid and wheels move freely; ice can block them.  
6. If temperatures drop below freezing, leave the lid slightly open so it doesn’t freeze shut.  
7. During strong winds or snow, keep bins close to a wall or fence to prevent tipping.  
8. If you’re using our valet service, make sure your driveway is clear for easy access.  
9. Protect the area from mud and puddles — it helps the team work faster and safer.  
10. Always stay informed with local weather updates and follow JHG Bin Wash for seasonal care reminders ❄️💙.

---

### 🚛 **Valet Service Tips**
1. The valet service means JHG Bin Wash will take your bins out before collection and return them clean afterward.  
2. Mark or label your bins or send a photo for easy identification.  
3. Make sure the path to the bins is clear of snow, ice, or obstacles.  
4. Keep pets indoors during valet pickup for everyone’s safety.  
5. If collection is early morning, place bins the night before in a visible spot.  
6. During bad weather (rain, snow, wind), leave bins in an accessible area under light cover if possible.  
7. You can combine valet with your regular cleaning plan for convenience.  
8. Valet is perfect for seniors, families, or anyone who prefers comfort and safety.  
9. Encourage people to stay informed and follow JHG Bin Wash for updates on service schedules and helpful home tips.
